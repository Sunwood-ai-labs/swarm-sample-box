>  swarm-sample-box is a template repository developed using [cline (formerly Claude Dev)](https://github.com/clinebot/cline), [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage), and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).  Most of the release notes, README, and commit messages are generated using the latest AI technologies.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Swarm Sample Box is an AI agent experimental repository that utilizes [Swarm, an experimental multi-agent orchestration framework developed by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/swarm). This repository provides a lightweight and flexible solution for efficiently coordinating multiple AI agents to perform complex tasks, supporting developers' research and experimentation. Version: v1.6.0

## ✨ Main Features

1. Diverse Agent Samples: Provides implementation examples of various AI agents, from basic dialogue to complex task processing.
2. Flexible Customization: Each sample can be easily extended and modified to adapt to your own use cases.
3. Integrated Experimental Environment: Provides a practical experimental environment, including Docker environment and integration with vector databases (Qdrant).
4. Automatic Evaluation Function: Some samples include automatic evaluation scripts to measure agent performance.

## 🔧 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box.git
   cd swarm-sample-box
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set the OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

5. Run a specific sample:
   ```bash
   cd examples/<sample name>
   python main.py
   ```


## 📦 Installation Instructions

## 🚀 Swarm Official Sample Tutorial

To effectively learn the Swarm framework, we recommend working through the samples in the following order. Each step introduces new concepts while building upon the knowledge gained in the previous steps.

### Step 1: Basic 🔥
**[Basic Sample](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/basic)**

This sample is the perfect starting point for learning the basics of Swarm.
- Introduces the core functions of Swarm with minimal implementation.
- Learn basic operations such as agent creation, simple dialogue, and function calls.
- Understand the basic operating principles of Swarm by understanding each function individually.

### Step 2: Weather Agent 🔥🔥
**[Weather Agent Sample](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/weather_agent)**

Once you understand the basics, try implementing more practical functions with a single agent.
- Learn through the specific use case of retrieving weather information.
- Understand how to handle multiple functions (weather information retrieval, email sending) with a single agent.
- Learn more about basic function calls and agent actions.

### Step 3: Triage Agent 🔥🔥
**[Triage Agent Sample](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/triage_agent)**

This is the first step in using multiple agents.
- Learn how to direct user requests to the appropriate agent.
- Understand the basics of interaction and collaboration between multiple agents.
- Begin to learn how to design more complex systems.

### Step 4: Personal Shopper 🔥🔥🔥
**[Personal Shopper Sample](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/personal_shopper)**

Take on a more complex use case closer to a real-world application.
- Learn through the specific business scenario of a shopping assistant.
- Understand implementations that include database operations and more advanced function calls.
- Gain experience closer to actual application development.


### Step 5: Airline 🔥🔥🔥🔥
**[Airline Sample](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/airline)**

Work on a complex system where multiple agents cooperate.
- Simulates a practical business scenario of an airline's customer service.
- Learn how multiple agents work together to solve problems.
- Experience the design and implementation of larger and more complex systems.

### Step 6: Support Bot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
**[Support Bot Sample](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/support_bot)**

Build a more full-fledged application that includes integration with external systems.
- Learn how to implement document search functionality using the Qdrant vector database.
- Understand a system with a configuration closer to a real production environment.
- Learn how to interact with external services and more advanced data processing techniques.


By following this learning order, you can deepen your understanding of the Swarm framework from the basics to advanced applications. By introducing new concepts and technologies at each step while utilizing the knowledge gained in the previous steps, you can learn effectively.
