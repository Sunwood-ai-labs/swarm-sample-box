> [!IMPORTANT]
>  swarm-sample-box is a template repository developed using [cline (formerly Claude Dev)](https://github.com/clinebot/cline), [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage), and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).  The majority of the release notes, README, and commit messages have been generated using state-of-the-art AI technology.


## üöÄ Project Overview

Swarm Sample Box is an AI agent experimentation repository utilizing [Swarm, an experimental multi-agent orchestration framework developed by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/swarm). This repository provides a lightweight and flexible solution for efficiently coordinating multiple AI agents to perform complex tasks, supporting developers' research and experimentation. Version: v1.5.0

## ‚ú® Main Features

- Diverse Agent Samples: Provides implementation examples of various AI agents, from basic conversations to complex task processing.
- Flexible Customization: Each sample can be easily extended and modified to adapt to your own use cases.
- Integrated Experimental Environment: Offers a practical experimental environment, including Docker environment and integration with a vector database (Qdrant).
- Automatic Evaluation Function: Some samples include automatic evaluation scripts to measure agent performance.
- Gemini Pro 002 model support

## üîß Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box.git
   cd swarm-sample-box
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

5. Run a specific sample:
   ```bash
   cd examples/<sample-name>
   python main.py
   ```


## üì¶ Installation Instructions

The `swarm` package needs to be installed from the GitHub repository, not PyPI, as specified in `requirements.txt`.  Therefore, please install it using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
```

## üÜï What's New

- The README for the Triage Agent sample has been significantly improved, adding a workflow diagram, setup instructions, evaluation tests, file structure, contribution guidelines, and license information.
- Added Gemini Pro 002 model support to the Triage Agent sample.


## üìö Sample List

### Official Samples (Translated to Japanese)

- Basic: A minimal implementation example showcasing basic Swarm functionality.
- Airline: A multi-agent setup simulating an airline's customer service.
- Personal Shopper: An implementation example of a personal shopping assistant agent.
- Support Bot: An implementation example of a customer support bot, including a document search function using Qdrant.
- Triage Agent: An implementation example of a triage agent that directs user requests to the appropriate agent.
- Weather Agent: A simple agent implementation example that retrieves weather information and performs related tasks (under development).
- Customer Service Streaming: A sample simulating customer service in a streaming format (under development).

### Original Samples

This section will introduce original samples that we have developed.  Currently under preparation, so please wait for future updates.

- [In preparation] New Original Sample 1: Details coming soon.
- [In preparation] New Original Sample 2: Details coming soon.


## ü§ù Contribution

Swarm Sample Box welcomes contributions from the community as an open-source project. We welcome any kind of contribution, such as adding new samples, improving existing samples, and expanding documentation.
