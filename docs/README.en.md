> [!IMPORTANT]
>  swarm-sample-box is a template repository developed using [cline (formerly Claude Dev)](https://github.com/clinebot/cline), [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage), and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).  Most of the release notes, README, and commit messages are generated using the latest AI technologies.


## üöÄ Project Overview

Swarm Sample Box is an AI agent experimentation repository utilizing [Swarm, an experimental multi-agent orchestration framework developed by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/swarm). This repository provides a lightweight and flexible solution for efficiently coordinating multiple AI agents to perform complex tasks, supporting developers' research and experimentation. Version: v1.6.0

## ‚ú® Main Features

1. Diverse Agent Samples: Provides implementation examples of various AI agents, from basic dialogue to complex task processing.
2. Flexible Customization: Each sample can be easily extended and modified to adapt to your own use cases.
3. Integrated Experimental Environment: Provides a practical experimental environment, including Docker environment and integration with vector databases (Qdrant).
4. Automated Evaluation Function: Some samples include automated evaluation scripts to measure agent performance.

## üîß Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box.git
   cd swarm-sample-box
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set the OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

5. Run a specific sample:
   ```bash
   cd examples/<sample_name>
   python main.py
   ```


## üì¶ Installation Instructions

Refer to the "Usage" section for installation instructions.


## üÜï Latest Updates
- Added ASCII art title display to the weather_agent sample.
- The weather_agent sample demo can now handle dummy weather data for multiple cities.
- Added `requirements.txt` to the weather_agent sample.
- Significantly improved the README for the weather_agent sample.


## üìö Sample List

### Official Samples (Translated to Japanese)

The following samples are translated from [the samples listed in the official OpenAI Swarm repository](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main/examples) and modified to be operational:

- [Basic](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/basic): A minimal implementation example that introduces the basic functions of Swarm.
- [Airline](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/airline): A multi-agent setup simulating airline customer service.
- [Personal Shopper](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/personal_shopper): An implementation example of a personal shopping assistant agent.
- [Support Bot](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/support_bot): An implementation example of a customer support bot, including document search functionality using Qdrant.
- [Triage Agent](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/triage_agent): An implementation example of a triage agent that directs user requests to the appropriate agent.
- [Weather Agent](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/weather_agent): A simple implementation example of an agent that retrieves weather information and performs related tasks.
- [Customer Service Streaming](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/customer_service_streaming): A sample that simulates customer service in a streaming format. (üî•Under Development)
