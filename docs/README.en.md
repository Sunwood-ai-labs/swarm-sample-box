> [!IMPORTANT]
>  swarm-sample-box is a template repository developed using [cline (formerly Claude Dev)](https://github.com/clinebot/cline), [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage), and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).  Most of the release notes, README, and commit messages are generated using the latest AI technologies.


## üöÄ Project Overview

Swarm Sample Box is an AI agent experimental repository utilizing [Swarm, an experimental multi-agent orchestration framework developed by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/swarm). This repository provides a lightweight and flexible solution for efficiently coordinating multiple AI agents to perform complex tasks, supporting developers' research and experimentation. Version: v1.3.1

## ‚ú® Main Features

1. **Diverse Agent Samples**: Provides implementation examples of various AI agents, from basic dialogue to complex task processing.
2. **Flexible Customization**: Each sample can be easily extended and modified, adaptable to your own use cases.
3. **Integrated Experimental Environment**: Offers a practical experimental environment, including Docker environment and integration with a vector database (Qdrant).
4. **Automatic Evaluation Function**: Some samples include automatic evaluation scripts to measure agent performance.
5. üéâ **Sample Question Display Function**: Added a function to display sample questions to the user.


## üîß Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box.git
   cd swarm-sample-box
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set the OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

5. Run a specific sample:
   ```bash
   cd examples/<sample name>
   python main.py
   ```

## üìö Sample List

### Official Samples (Translated to Japanese)

The following samples are Japanese translations of the samples described in the [official OpenAI Swarm repository](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main/examples), modified to be operational:

- [Basic](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/basic): A minimal implementation example showcasing basic Swarm functionality.
- [Airline](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/airline): A multi-agent setup simulating an airline's customer service.
- [Personal Shopper](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/personal_shopper): An implementation example of a personal shopping assistant agent.
- [Support Bot](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/support_bot): An implementation example of a customer support bot, including document search functionality using Qdrant.
- [Triage Agent](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/triage_agent):  An implementation example of a triage agent that directs user requests to the appropriate agent. (üî•Under Development)
- [Weather Agent](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/weather_agent): A simple implementation example of an agent that retrieves weather information and performs related tasks. (üî•Under Development)
- [Customer Service Streaming](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/swarm-sample-box/tree/main/examples/customer_service_streaming): A sample simulating customer service in a streaming format. (üî•Under Development)

### Original Samples

This section will introduce originally developed samples.  Currently under preparation, so please wait for future updates.

- [In Preparation] New Original Sample 1: Details coming soon
- [In Preparation] New Original Sample 2: Details coming soon

## üß™ Evaluation Method

Some samples include automatic evaluation scripts. To run the evaluation, execute the following command in the sample directory:

```bash
pytest evals.py
```

## üì¶ Upgrade Procedure

1. Clone or pull the latest version of the repository.
2. Update dependencies with `make install`.
3. Restart the Docker containers with `docker-compose up -d`. (For Support Bot, also run `make prep`)
4. Run the data preparation script with `make prep` in the relevant sample directory.
5. Run the application with `make run`.
